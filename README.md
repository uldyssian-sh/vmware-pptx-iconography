## Updated PowerPoint Iconography

VMware PowerPoint icons are available as vector art to use in PowerPoint presentations.  

- Recolor the icons with the **Color Fill** tool using the VMware Brand colors in the color palette.  
- **Do not** use colors outside of the template palette.  
- **Do not** apply a color outline to these shapes.  
- Scale the icons **proportionally** by holding down **Shift** when resizing.  
- **Do not distort** the icon shapes.  
- When displaying adjacent icons, keep all icons the **same size** and make sure they are **aligned**.  

For your convenience, individual VMware PowerPoint icons are available in the appendix of official decks.
